# Kivy-Stopwatch
## What is it and why did I do it?
<p>This is a simple Stopwatch made in Kivy (naturaly resizable, multiplatform framework).</p>
<p>I am fairly new to Kivy, so I am doing a lot of smaller projects, and I decided to do stopwatch, so that I could learn how to use the clock feature from Kivy</p>
